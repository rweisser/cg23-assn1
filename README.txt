Assignment One for Computer Graphics (CMSC 435 at UMBC)

The task for this assignment was to render an image, using ray
casting, from an input file in rayshade format.  The class is over and
the project has already been graded.  In this repository, I am doing
addtitional work on it.  The main program is Trace.cpp.  The output
file is a .ppm file.

There is no real ray tracing in this assignment, only ray casting.
Ray tracing is implemented in Assignment Two.

I plan to do the following:

Make the project more object-oriented.

Do some or all of the extra-credit.
