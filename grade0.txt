Generally once you have an ssh key it is just easier, as you can use ssh-agent
to add that key and you don't have to keep typing your passphrase for that
session. It doesn't really matter though, use whatever you want.

Regarding defining origin and mater/main, when you clone from somewhere, git
assumes that "somewhere" is your origin and you want it's default branch (main
in this case). If you were to make a new repo with "git init" you would have to
manually define the remotes and branches you wanna use.
