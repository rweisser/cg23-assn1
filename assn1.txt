Assignment 1

Everything appears to working.  The only thing that I am worried about
is that the colors in my image seem to be brighter or somehow more
intense than the ones in the picture on the assignment page.

NOTE:  As I mentioned to Professor Olano during office hours, I wrote
the Vec2 and Vec3 classes before class started.  After reading some of
the Shirley Fundamentals of Computer Graphics before class started, I
created them in a seperate Visual Studio 2019 solution, which I would
be happy to show if necessary.  The first commit on the related files
was therefore of almost complete versions, since they were created
before I started using git.  After that, I did have to make some minor
changes, which do appear in commits.  He said that it was no problem.

I looked up a lot of c++ documentation on cppreference.com.  My c++
knowledge did not include much after C++98.

I made one decision which I regret.  The program wrote out each pixel
as soon as it calculated it.  When I decided to do that, I wasn't
thinking about how much slower it would be, in comparison with writing
out an array of pixels with one system call.

Outside sources:

    cppreference.com.  I went there often.
    
    Shirley.  Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.  I read some sections
    in this book, but the level was generally too high.  I found the
    class slides to be more helpful than the book.
