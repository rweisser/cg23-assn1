Assignment 1

NOTE:  As I mentioned to Professor Olano during office hours, I wrote
the Vec2 and Vec3 classes before class started.  After reading some of
the Shirley Fundamentals of Computer Graphics before class started, I
created them in a seperate Visual Studio 2019 solution, which I would
be happy to show if necessary.  The first commit on the related files
was therefore of almost complete versions, since they were created
before I started using git.  After that, I did have to make some minor
changes, which do appear in commits.  I hope this is okay.

I looked up a lot of c++ documentation on cppreference.com.  My c++
knowledge did not include much after C++98.
